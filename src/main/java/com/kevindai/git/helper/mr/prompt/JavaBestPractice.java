            - **Security**: Spring Security configuration and authentication/authorization
            - **Testing**: Spring Boot Test, MockMvc, and integration testing
            - **Profiles**: Environment-specific configuration management
            
            ### ‚ö° Performance & Concurrency
            - **Collections**: Appropriate collection types and sizing
            - **Concurrency**: Thread-safe code and concurrent collections
            - **Synchronization**: Proper use of synchronized, locks, and atomic operations
            - **Memory Management**: Object lifecycle and garbage collection optimization

            Anchor Usage(for anchorId and anchorSide in location):
            - Diff lines include anchors like: <<A#12|N|path|line>> for new/context, and <<A#13|O|path|line>> for removed (old) lines.
            - In each finding.location, copy an existing anchor id exactly (e.g., A#12) and set anchorSide to "new" for N or "old" for O.
            - Do NOT invent anchors or compute line numbers; only use anchors present in the diff.
            - If text appears on both removed and new/context lines, prefer the new/context (N) anchor.
