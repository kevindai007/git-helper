            ## üß† Python Best Practices Analysis Framework

            ### Step 1: Language & Idioms
            - Assess Pythonic style, readability, and use of idioms
            - Evaluate adherence to PEP 8 (style), PEP 20 (Zen), and PEP 257 (docstrings)
            - Review use of comprehensions, generators, context managers, and unpacking
            - Check appropriate use of dataclasses, enums, and typing

            ### Step 2: Type Hints & Static Analysis
            - Evaluate completeness and correctness of type hints (PEP 484, 585, 604)
            - Consider use of Protocols, TypedDict, and generics where helpful
            - Encourage mypy/pyright-friendly code and clear public interfaces

            ### Step 3: Error Handling & Robustness
            - Review exception types, specificity, and try/except/else/finally structure
            - Avoid bare except; log and re-raise appropriately
            - Use contextlib and with-statements for resource safety

            ### Step 4: Performance & Memory
            - Evaluate data structure choices (list/dict/set/tuple/deque) and algorithmic complexity
            - Consider generator usage to reduce memory footprint
            - Identify hotspots that might benefit from vectorization, caching, or native extensions

            ### Step 5: Concurrency & Async
            - Assess correct use of asyncio (await, tasks, cancellation, timeouts)
            - Evaluate concurrency models: threads, processes, async, queues
            - Ensure thread/process safety where applicable

            ### Step 6: Packaging & Dependencies
            - Review dependency management (pip/Poetry), version pinning, and virtualenv usage
            - Check for safe imports, avoiding heavy imports at module import time if not needed
            - Validate module/package structure and __init__ exposure

            ### Step 7: Framework & Library Usage
            - If using frameworks (FastAPI/Flask/Django), assess routing, validation, and configuration patterns
            - Validate pydantic/dataclasses usage for DTOs and settings
            - Check logging configuration and structured logging

            ## ‚úÖ Python-Specific Best Practices Checklist

            ### üêç Pythonic Code & Style
            - Clear, readable, idiomatic Python (PEP 8/20)
            - Meaningful names, short functions, single-responsibility
            - Comprehensions/generators for concise, efficient loops
            - Dataclasses for immutable/value objects when appropriate

            ### üìù Type Hints & Docs
            - Consistent type hints, especially on public interfaces
            - Docstrings describing purpose, params, return, and exceptions
            - Helpful comments where complexity is unavoidable

            ### üõ°Ô∏è Errors & Validation
            - Specific exceptions; avoid catching broad Exception
            - Validate inputs; fail fast with clear messages
            - Use context managers for files, locks, and network resources

            ### ‚ö° Performance & Async
            - Appropriate data structures and algorithms
            - Use functools.lru_cache where beneficial
            - Correct async patterns; avoid blocking in event loop

            ### üì¶ Packaging & Config
            - Clean package layout; avoid circular imports
            - Config via environment/12-factor; secrets not in code
            - Reproducible dependency management and lockfiles

            ### üîê Security
            - Avoid eval/exec; safe deserialization
            - Input sanitization; parameterized queries; secrets handling
            - Keep dependencies updated; address known CVEs

            ### üß™ Testing & Tooling
            - pytest structure, fixtures, parametrize, coverage
            - Linting (flake8/ruff), formatting (black), type-checking (mypy/pyright)
            **Analysis Focus**: Favor explicit, readable, and maintainable Python code with proper typing, error handling, and async safety. Provide actionable, prioritized suggestions.

            
            Output Format (Strict):
            - Respond with a single JSON object only. No prose, no markdown.
            - Use these fields exactly. Omit nulls if not applicable.
            - If no issues: return an empty `findings` array and a brief `summaryMarkdown`.

            Schema:
            {
              "schemaVersion": "1.0",
              "promptType": "PYTHON",
              "findings": [
                {
                  "id": "string",
                  "severity": "blocker|high|medium|low|info",
                  "category": "correctness|performance|security|maintainability|style|docs|tests",
                  "title": "string",
                  "description": "string",
                  "location": { "file": "path", "lineType": "old_line|new_line", "startLine": 0, "anchorId": "A#123", "anchorSide": "new|old" },
                  "evidence": "string (brief snippet)",
                  "remediation": { "steps": "string" },
                  "confidence": 0.0,
                  "tags": ["string"]
                }
              ],
              "summaryMarkdown": "string"
            }
            
            Anchor Usage(for anchorId and anchorSide in location):
            - Diff lines include anchors like: <<A#12|N|path|line>> for new/context, and <<A#13|O|path|line>> for removed (old) lines.
            - In each finding.location, copy an existing anchor id exactly (e.g., A#12) and set anchorSide to "new" for N or "old" for O.
            - Do NOT invent anchors or compute line numbers; only use anchors present in the diff.
            - If text appears on both removed and new/context lines, prefer the new/context (N) anchor.
